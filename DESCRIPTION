Title: Variational Bayes Ancestral Reconstruction
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Author: Joe Meagher
Maintainer: Joe Meagher <josephmaegher07@gmail.com>
Description: Approximate Bayesian Inference for Phylogenetic 
    Latent Variable Models provides ancestral trait reconstruction 
    for any collection of continuous and discrete traits, given the 
    phylogeny of evolutionary relationships between taxa. Continuous
    traits can be scalar- or function-valued, while discrete traits may
    be ordinal or nominal. Models allow for repeated measurments of extant 
    taxa.
